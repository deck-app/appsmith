## Introduction

[Appsmith](www.appsmith.com), is the first open-source low code tool that helps developers build dashboards and admin panels very quickly. It's a platform that helps businesses build any custom internal application within hours.


## Getting started
### Install
#### Using DECK

Install appsmith from the DECK marketplace and follow the instructions on the GUI

#### From terminal with Docker
The quickest way to get started with the Symfony Development Container is using docker-compose.
Download the docker-compose.yml file in the application directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/deck-app/appsmith.git
$ cd appsmith
$ docker-compose up -d
```
## Exporting Your Data
Once you begin using Appsmith, youâ€™ll quickly assemble apps which could be difficult to replicate in the future. You should frequently back up your installation to guard against data loss.

The Docker image includes a command that can produce a complete archive on-demand:
```
docker-compose exec <contaner name> appsmithctl export_db
```
The backup will be stored to /appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive inside the container. Use docker cp to move the archive to your Docker host:
```
docker cp <contaner name>:/appsmith-stacks/data/backup/appsmith-data.archive appsmith-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).archive
```
Next copy the /appsmith-stacks/configuration directory out of the container. Including these files in your final backup will avoid having to reconstruct your config file after a backup restoration. Now you can upload your backup to cloud storage or a dedicated server to protect your data if your Docker host suffers a failure.
To restore a backup archive in the future, copy it to /appsmith-stacks/data/restore in a new Appsmith container and run the import_db command:

```
docker cp appsmith-backup-2022-04-13.archive <contaner name>:/appsmith-stacks/data/restore
docker-compose exec <contaner name> appsmithctl import_db
```
Restart Appsmith to complete the restoration:
```
docker-compose restart <contaner name>
```
